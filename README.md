# HR-Data-Analysis-Project--2
As a part of my Data Science internship at OESON, one of my tasks was to perform HR data analysis using various Python libraries. I was responsible for creating visualizations using Seaborn/Matplotlib and drawing meaningful insights from the data by visualizing charts between multiple columns.
